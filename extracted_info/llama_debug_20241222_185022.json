Zapier makes it easy for you to move data between your apps without being a developer. We may need you to locate information for certain accounts, but we'll guide you through any additional steps. Our Support champions are also here to help you via email should you need assistance.\n\nWhat are apps?\n\nAn app is a web service or application, such as [Google Docs](https://zapier.com/apps/google-docs/integrations), [Evernote](https://zapier.com/apps/evernote/integrations), or [Salesforce](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/integrations). Zapier offers integrations for more than 7,000 apps and helps you easily move data between them to automate repetitive tasks. [Premium apps](https://zapier.com/apps?filter=premium) are select apps exclusively available to users on paid Zapier plans.\n\nWhat is a Zap?\n\nA Zap is an automated workflow that connects your apps and services together. Each Zap consists of a trigger and one or more actions. When you turn your Zap on, it will run the action steps every time the trigger event occurs.\n\nWhat are tasks?\n\nA task is counted every time a Zap successfully moves data or completes an action for you automatically. For example, if your Zap has an action to create new Google Contacts, each contact created will use one task. If the action isn't successfully completed, it doesn't count against your task limit.\n\nWhat is a trigger?\n\nA trigger is an event that starts a Zap. Once you turn on a Zap, Zapier will monitor for that trigger event. For example, if you create a Zap that sends a message to a rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is a new lead entering your lead management app. Triggers don't count toward your task limit.\n\nWhat's the difference between Zaps, triggers, actions, and tasks?\n\nZap is our term for the automated workflows you set up to connect your apps. A trigger is the event that starts your Zap. Actions are events that happen automatically after your Zap is triggered. For example, in a Zap that sends a message to a Sales rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is the new lead entering your lead management app, and the action is the Slack notification sent with the new lead's info.\n\nWhen Zapier performs an action successfully, it counts as a task. Each successful action in a Zap counts as a separate task.\n\nDoes checking (or polling) for new data use tasks?\n\nZapier never charges you a task to check for new data\u2014only when a Zap successfully completes an action for you.\n\nFor instance, say you want an automated workflow to check\u2014or poll\u2014your Dropbox account every five minutes for new files. Then, if a new file appears, the workflow will send you a Slack message. In this case, sending the Slack message about the new Dropbox file counts as a task.\n\nHow many tasks do I need?\n\nThe number of tasks you need depends on the number of active Zaps you have and how frequently those Zaps run to automate your work. The more actions your Zaps complete, the more tasks you'll need.\n\nBut don't worry! When you reach your plan\u2019s task limit, we'll notify you via email. When you reach your plan\u2019s task limit, we'll also switch you to [pay-per-task billing](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901#h_01HKCH7TXPGX4SZBRP521QYY5Y).\n\nWhat happens if I hit my task limit?\n\nWe'll email you when you reach your plan's task limit. Once you've reached that limit, we'll switch you to pay-per-task billing at a rate of 1.25x the cost of a base task on your subscription so your Zaps continue running.\n\nWhen you're on pay-per-task billing, we\u2019ll email you if you\u2019re close to your plan\u2019s maximum task limit (3x your task subscription) and then again when you reach it. Once you\u2019ve reached your maximum task limit, your Zaps will pause until the start of your next pay period.\n\nYou can [learn more about task overages here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901-Metered-tasks-in-Zapier).

If you upgrade, the change happens immediately, and you'll only pay a prorated amount for the rest of the billing cycle. If you choose to downgrade, it'll take effect at the end of that billing cycle.\n\nWhat if I decide to cancel?\n\nIf you no longer wish to use Zapier, you may cancel at any time. You'll still have access to your paid plan for the remainder of your billing cycle.

It uses regular expressions to parse the HTML content and identify the different sections of the page. Note that this script assumes that the pricing page has a specific structure and may break if the structure changes. \n\nTo fix the issue, please modify the `extract_service_info` method to properly handle the HTML structure of the pricing pages. Also, note that the `_parse_plan` function assumes that all plans have the same structure, which might not be the case. You might need to adjust the regular expression patterns accordingly. \n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```python  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"\nZapair Pricing Page Scraper\n\nUsage:\n    python zapier_pricing_scraper.py\n\"\"\"\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport json\n\nclass ZapierPricingScraper:\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrapes the Zapari pricing page for the latest pricing information.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_zapier_pricings(self):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the pricing information.\"\"\"\n        url = 'https:// zapier.com/prixing'\n        response=requests.get(url)\n        html=response.content\n        soup=BeautifulSoup(html,'lxml')\n\n        self.parse_plans()\n\n    def find_zap(self):\n      \"\"\"Find the Zap name.\"\"\"\n      title=soup.find('h1','title').string.strip()\n      return title\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def process_data(data):\n        \"\"\"Processes the scraped data.\"\"\"\n        service_info = data['service']\n        plans_info=data['plans']\n\n        metadata = {\n          'Currency': 'USD',\n          'Regions': ['United States'],\n          'Billing Cycles': ['Monthly', 'Yearly'],\n          # Add more metadata fields as needed\n        }\n\n        plans_data = []\n\n        for i, plan in enumerate(plans_info):\n            plan_data = {\n                'Name' : plan['name'],\n                'Slug' : i,\n                'Base' : {\n                    'Amount': plan['price']['base_amount'],\n                    'Period' : 'Month',\n                    'Currency' : metadata['Currency']\n                },\n                'Usage-Based Components' : [\n                    {\n                        'Name':'Task',\n                        'Type':'task',\n                        \"Unit\": \"tasks\",\n                        \"Tiers\":[\n                            {\"Range\":\"unlimited\", \"Unit Price\": plan[\"price\"][\"task_unit_price\"], \"Flat Fee\":\"\"},\n                        ],\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"Limits\": {\n                  \"Users\" : {\n                      \"Minimum\" : plan[\"users_min\"],\n                      \"Maximum\" :  plan[\"user_max\"],\n                  },\n                  \"Storage\" :{\n                      \"Amount\" :plan[\"storage_size\"],\n                      'Unit' :\"GB\"\n                  },\n                 \"API\" :{\"Requests\":{\"Rate\" : 'unlimited', \"Time Period\": plan['api_requests_period'], 'Quota' :'unlimited'},\n                },\n               \"Compute\": {\n                   \"VCPU\" : None,\n                   \"Memory\" :None,\n                   'Unit':\"MB\"\n                },\n              \"Other Limits\":{\n                \"Name\" :\"Other\",\n                \"Value\" : \"\",\n                \"Description\" :\"\"\n            },\n             \"Features\" :[\n                {\"Category\" :\"Security\", \"Feature\" :\"Authentication\", \"Description\":\"Authentication\", 'Included' :\"included\"},\n                {\"category\" :\"Integrations\", \"feature\" :\"Zap\", \"description\":\"Zap integration\", 'included':'included'}\n            ]\n        }\n\n         plans_data.append(plan_data)\n\n        metadata['Plans'] = plans_data\n        metadata[\"Service\"] = service_info\n        return metadata\n\n\ndef main():\n    scraper = ZapierPrisingScraper()\n    data = scraper.get_zap()\n    result = ZapiringScraper.process_data(data)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNote that the modified version is a simplified example. In practice, you would likely need to handle edge cases and errors more robustly. Additionally, this code assumes that there is only one pricing page on the website; if there are multiple pages, you will need to modify the code to handle them correctly."

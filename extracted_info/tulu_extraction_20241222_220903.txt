Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### Zapier overview

Do I need to know how to code?

Nope! Zapier makes it easy for you to move data between your apps without being a developer. We may need you to locate information for certain accounts, but we'll guide you through any additional steps. Our Support champions are also here to help you via email should you need assistance.

What are apps?

An app is a web service or application, such as [Google Docs](https://zapier.com/apps/google-docs/integrations), [Evernote](https://zapier.com/apps/evernote/integrations), or [Salesforce](https://zapier.com/apps/salesforce/integrations). Zapier offers integrations for more than 7,000 apps and helps you easily move data between them to automate repetitive tasks. [Premium apps](https://zapier.com/apps?filter=premium) are select apps exclusively available to users on paid Zapier plans.

What is a Zap?

A Zap is an automated workflow that connects your apps and services together. Each Zap consists of a trigger and one or more actions. When you turn your Zap on, it will run the action steps every time the trigger event occurs.

What are tasks?

A task is counted every time a Zap successfully moves data or completes an action for you automatically. For example, if your Zap has an action to create new Google Contacts, each contact created will use one task. If the action isn't successfully completed, it doesn't count against your task limit.

What is a trigger?

A trigger is an event that starts a Zap. Once you turn on a Zap, Zapier will monitor for that trigger event. For example, if you create a Zap that sends a message to a rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is a new lead entering your lead management app. Triggers don't count toward your task limit.

What's the difference between Zaps, triggers, actions, and tasks?

Zap is our term for the automated workflows you set up to connect your apps. A trigger is the event that starts your Zap. Actions are events that happen automatically after your Zap is triggered. For example, in a Zap that sends a message to a Sales rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is the new lead entering your lead management app, and the action is the Slack notification sent with the new lead's info.

When Zapier performs an action successfully, it counts as a task. Each successful action in a Zap counts as a separate task.

Does checking (or polling) for new data use tasks?

Zapier never charges you a task to check for new dataâ€”only when a Zap successfully completes an action for you.

For instance, say you want an automated workflow to checkâ€”or pollâ€”your Dropbox account every five minutes for new files. Then, if a new file appears, the workflow will send you a Slack message. In this case, sending the Slack message about the new Dropbox file counts as a task.

How many tasks do I need?

The number of tasks you need depends on the number of active Zaps you have and how frequently those Zaps run to automate your work. The more actions your Zaps complete, the more tasks you'll need.

But don't worry! When you reach your planâ€™s task limit, we'll notify you via email. When you reach your planâ€™s task limit, we'll also switch you to [pay-per-task billing](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901#h_01HKCH7TXPGX4SZBRP521QYY5Y).

What happens if I hit my task limit?

We'll email you when you reach your plan's task limit. Once you've reached that limit, we'll switch you to pay-per-task billing at a rate of 1.25x the cost of a base task on your subscription so your Zaps continue running.

When you're on pay-per-task billing, weâ€™ll email you if youâ€™re close to your planâ€™s maximum task limit (3x your task subscription) and then again when you reach it. Once youâ€™ve reached your maximum task limit, your Zaps will pause until the start of your next pay period.

You can [learn more about task overages here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15279018245901-Metered-tasks-in-Zapier). Our [Sales team](https://zapier.com/l/contact-sales?demo_source=pricing-logged-out_faq_section) is also available to help you choose the right plan for your business.

Will I be charged a task for any of Zapierâ€™s built-in data tools?

Zapier offers a variety of [built-in data tools in the App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps/categories/zapier-tools) that help you add conditional filter and path logic, and format data. The following steps don't count as a task:

*   Zapier Tables
*   Zapier Interfaces
*   Filter by Zapier
*   Formatter by Zapier
*   Path by Zapier
*   Delay, Looping, Sub-Zap, Digest, Zapier Manager, Storage

How many connections does Zapier support?

Zapier connects to 7,000+ apps, more than any other automation tool. If you want to connect your internal tools, you can build your own private integration with our easy-to-use [developer platform](https://developer.zapier.com/).

### Plans and payments

Should I use the Team or Enterprise plan?

The Team plan provides features that facilitate collaboration on automation across several groups or teams. These features include shared app connections and a shared workspace. The Company plan makes it easy for your entire distributed organization to use Zapier, and includes advanced security, governance, and monitoring features such as advanced admin permissions, single sign-on, and custom data retention.

The Enterprise plan enables your entire team to use Zapier, with advanced security features, governance, and monitoring features such as advanced admin permissions, single sign-on, and custom data retention. Enterprise allows you to empower all of your employees while providing safeguards you need to protect sensitive data and critical workflows.

Which plans allow for unlimited users?

Unlimited users are available on Team and Enterprise plans.

Do you have a free trial of your premium features?

Yes! When you create a new Zapier account, you're instantly enrolled in a [free 14-day trial](https://zapier.com/help/account/billing-pricing/understand-your-free-zapier-trial) of the Zapier Professional plan. No credit card required.

Please [contact our Sales team](https://zapier.com/l/contact-sales?demo_source=pricing-logged-out_faq_section) if you want to enroll in a free trial of the Zapier Team and Enterprise plans to experience our most advanced collaboration features and admin controls.

Can I change my plan later?

Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. If you upgrade, the change happens immediately, and you'll only pay a prorated amount for the rest of the billing cycle. If you choose to downgrade, it'll take effect at the end of that billing cycle.

What if I decide to cancel?

If you no longer wish to use Zapier, you may cancel at any time. You'll still have access to your paid plan for the remainder of your billing cycle. See also our [refund policy](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496260621197-Zapier-s-refund-policy) here.

Do you offer any discounts?

Yes! When you choose to pre-pay for a year of service, you'll receive a discount compared to monthly payments. Please see the pricing details above.

We also offer an additional 15% discount for non-profits. Learn more [here](https://zapier.com/non-profits/).

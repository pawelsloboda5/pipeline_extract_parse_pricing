Post on our [community forum](https://community.auth0.com/tag/forum) to receive help from our developer support team and the community.  \n  \nFor enterprise question, you can [contact an expert](https://auth0.com/contact-us?place=pricing-faq&type=hyperlink&text=contact%20an%20expert&target=contact-us).\n\nWhy should I trust Auth0 with my users?\n\nSecurity is our utmost priority. For starters, we follow security best practices for storing user credentials: they are never stored in plain text, and all passwords are hashed and salted using the [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm, a state-of-the-art algorithm designed to prevent brute-force attacks even in case of a breach. Furthermore, our implementation of TLS has received an \u201cA+\u201d score in [Qualsys\u2019 SSL Labs SSL Server test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=manage.auth0.com). We also implement proactive security measures for your projects such as password breach detection, using a huge database of leaked passwords, and brute-force attack detection. Automated rate-limiting checks and denial of service mitigation procedures are also in place. You can learn more about security at Auth0 at our [security page](https://auth0.com/security/).\n\n\n=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nWhat happens if I stop using Auth0? How do I know my user's data is safe?\n\nYour data is safe as long as it\u2019s stored in our servers. If you choose to stop using Auth0, exporting your data is a simple matter. Head over to the Auth0 Dashboard and go to the extensions page. Select \u201cUser Import/Export\u201d and proceed to enable the extension. If you need help using the extension, check our [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/user-import-export). If you feel the export extension does not fill your needs, the [Auth0 management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!) lets you fully inspect all the data from your account. With it, you can export all data to any format.\n\n\n=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nIf I surpass the 25,000 users Free Plan do I need to select a Paid Plan with a higher MAU Quota?\n\nYes, if you pass the 25,000 users mark, you need to select an applicable paid Plan and select the right amount of users for your use case.

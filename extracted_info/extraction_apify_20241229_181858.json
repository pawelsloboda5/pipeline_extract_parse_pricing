See [pricing](https://apify.com/pricing) for the full list of platform services.\n\nEach subscription plan comes with a certain amount of prepaid platform usage that is used to pay for services. If your platform usage in a given billing cycle exceeds this prepaid amount, the excess usage will be added to your next invoice, and you'll get a notification. If you're on the free plan, your access to Apify's services will be blocked until the beginning of the next monthly cycle.\n\n**Note that unused usage credits are not rolled over to the next billing cycle, and they expire at the end of the billing cycle.**\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#can-i-try-apify-for-free)\n\n### Can I try Apify for free?\n\nAbsolutely! We offer a [free plan](https://apify.com/pricing) that lets you use most of the features of the Apify platform, but with certain limits. No credit card is required. The free plan includes Apify Proxy, which is limited to use within the platform and does not extend to external clients.\n\nIf you'd like a free demo of Apify's custom solutions, please [contact us](https://apify.com/contact-sales/demo).\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#which-plan-should-i-choose)\n\n### Which plan should I choose?\n\nIf you're unsure which plan is right for you, just pick the lowest-priced plan that has all the features you need. If you exceed the prepaid platform usage, you'll get a notification, and the excess usage will be added to the next invoice (see below for details).\n\nYou can upgrade to a higher plan at any time in your [Billing](https://console.apify.com/billing) settings, and you'll only pay for the price difference.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#what-is-the-pricing-for-actors-in-apify-store)\n\n### What is the pricing for Actors in Apify Store?\n\nThe Actors in Apify Store are either free or have to be rented for a monthly fee specific to each Actor. Running Actors will consume the platform usage credits included in your plan. Excess usage will be charged to your next invoice.\n\nThe exact platform usage depends on the specific Actor, the type of job it performs, how often it runs, and for how long. The easiest way to find out the platform usage of an Actor is to perform a test run. You can then review your platform usage in your [Billing](https://console.apify.com/billing) settings and figure out the best subscription plan for your needs.\n\nIf you need advice, please [contact us](https://apify.com/contact-sales).\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#can-i-upgrade-downgrade-or-cancel-my-plan)\n\n### Can I upgrade, downgrade or cancel my plan?\n\nYou can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time in your [Billing](https://console.apify.com/billing) settings.\n\nWhen you upgrade, your payment will be prorated, so you will only pay for the difference between the old and the new price, taking into account how much of the billing cycle has already passed.\n\nWhen you downgrade, there's no proration except for the unused platform usage that's rolled over to the new plan.\n\nIf you decide to cancel, your subscription will last until the end of the current billing cycle. It won't be renewed after that. Note that you might still be charged for excess platform usage.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#what-drives-the-cost-of-an-actor-run)\n\n### What drives the cost of an Actor run?\n\nThe cost of an Actor run depends on the compute unit consumption, storage, proxies used, and data transfer. You can check your daily [usage chart](https://console.apify.com/billing) on the Apify platform.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#what-happens-after-i-run-out-of-prepaid-usage)\n\n### What happens after I run out of prepaid usage?\n\nIf you're a paying user, you can continue using the platform and will be charged for overage until you reach the usage limit configured in the billing. If you're on the free plan, you'll be blocked until the next billing cycle.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#what-happens-to-my-prepaid-usage-if-i-dont-use-all-of-it)\n\n### What happens to my prepaid usage if I don't use all of it?\n\nIf you don't consume all your prepaid usage, it disappears at the end of the billing cycle. Go to our [pricing](https://apify.com/pricing) page to learn more about the prepaid usage of all Apify's subscription plans.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#why-do-some-of-my-actor-runs-cost-more-than-others)\n\n### Why do some of my Actor runs cost more than others?\n\nThe cost of Actor runs depends on the resources used - proxies, data transfers, or runs with a higher memory/CPU. It also depends on the number of retries when a request fails.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#how-does-apify-pay-as-you-go-work)\n\n### How does Apify pay as you go work?\n\nIf you're on one of Apify's paid plans, you can continue using the platform after reaching the limit by paying the rest as overage. That means you don't have to change your pricing plan to exceed the usage limit of your current plan.\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#does-apify-offer-any-discounts-for-universities-or-nonprofit-organizations)\n\n### Does Apify offer any discounts for universities or nonprofit organizations?\n\nApify offers discounts on its paid plans to both academic institutions and nonprofit organizations. Students are eligible for 30% off Starter and Scale plans, while nonprofits can get a personalized discount. Learn more at [Apify for universities](https://apify.com/resources/universities) and [Apify for nonprofits](https://apify.com/resources/nonprofits).\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#do-startups-get-the-same-pricing-as-enterprise-customers)\n\n### Do startups get the same pricing as enterprise customers?\n\nApify believes in encouraging startups to grow by using online data at scale. So we're giving a special 30% discount on our Scale plan to startups. Learn more at [Apify for startups](https://apify.com/resources/startups).\n\n[](https://apify.com/pricing#i-would-like-to-develop-actors-what-should-i-do)\n\n### I would like to develop Actors.

to Frame.io Enterprise Select package\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve coined the term \u201ccollaboration velocity.\u201d With Frame.io we\u2019re able to communicate at speeds we\u2019ve never been able to before.\u201d\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScott Martin _Senior Manager of Media Production, Princess Cruises_\n\nFrequently  \nasked questions\n----------------------------\n\nHow do monthly and annual pricing differ?\n\nWhen you subscribe to the monthly plan, you will automatically be charged monthly until you cancel. We offer a 13% discount on annual plans. When you subscribe to the annual plan, you will automatically be charged annually, and your subscription will automatically renew annually until you cancel.\n\nHow many users are included in Pro and Team plans?\n\nThe pricing table above shows the cost of a single user for each plan. However, you can add up to 5 users to the Pro plan or 15 users to the Team plan. If you need more than 15 users, please contact us to talk about an Enterprise plan for your company.\n\nIs there a minimum contract length?\n\nWhen you enroll in a monthly or annual plan, you pay up-front to access Frame.io for the next month or year, respectively. However, you may cancel at any time during your billing cycle and you\u2019ll retain full access to that plan until the end of that billing cycle.\n\nHow does the free trial work?\n\nYou\u2019ll need to enter your contact and billing information to sign up for the free trial, but you won\u2019t be charged to use Frame.io during the free trial period. Billing begins when your free trial ends. When the free trial ends, you\u2019ll be automatically enrolled in a monthly or annual plan and billed for the next month or year depending on your selection. You may cancel at any time before your free trial ends and you won\u2019t be charged. Subscription automatically renews until you cancel.\n\nWill I be charged sales tax?\n\nYes. We apply applicable taxes to your total charge based on your billing address.\n\nWho on my account can add paid users?\n\nThe Account Owner and anyone assigned as a Content Admin can add new paid users. Additionally, Members can add additional Members if they have been granted permission within a Workspace or Project. Adding additional Members to your account will increases the cost of your subscription.\n\nWhat happens if I exceed my current plan limits?\n\nIf you exceed your current plan limits, the application will warn you about which limit you\u2019ve exceeded. You will then have a brief window of time to meet your current plan limits or upgrade to a higher plan, during which time you can continue to work without interruption.\n\nDo my external clients need to have an account?\n\nNo. You can securely share assets with anyone outside your Frame.io account for free via Share links, which don't require them to sign up or log in. Users that you have sent or added to a Share will be visible as a Reviewer in your account. Reviewers are notified immediately via email, and can view and comment using their browser or the free iPhone and iPad apps\n\nCan I upgrade my plan mid-cycle?\n\nOf course. When you upgrade, you\u2019ll be charged a pro-rated amount equal to the cost of the new plan minus the cost of the remaining, unused days from your current plan.\n\n### Start using Frame.io  \ntoday for free.\n\n[Start Free Trial](https://accounts.frame.io/welcome/?signup_as_v4_account=true)\n\n[](https://frame.io/)\n\nFeatures\n\n*   [Workflow Management](https://frame.io/features/workflow-management)\n*   [File Management](https://frame.io/features/file-management)\n*   [Share & Present](https://frame.io/features/present)\n*   [Review & Approval](https://frame.io/features/review-and-approval)\n*   [iOS & iPad](https://frame.io/features/ios-ipad)\n*   [Camera to Cloud](https://frame.io/features/c2c)\n*   [Transfer](https://frame.io/transfer)\n\nResources\n\n*   [Blog](https://blog.frame.io/)\n*   [Customer Stories](https://frame.io/customers)\n*   [Frame.io Live](https://frame.io/live)\n*   [What's New](https://frame.io/whats-new)\n*   [Support](https://help.frame.io/en/)\n*   [Resource Hub](https://frame.io/resources)\n*   [Developers](https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/)\n*   [Status](https://status.frame.io/)\n\nEnterprise\n\n*   [Overview](https://frame.io/enterprise)\n*   [Agencies](https://frame.io/enterprise/agencies)\n*   [Brands](https://frame.io/enterprise/brands)\n*   [Media & Entertainment](https://frame.io/enterprise/media-and-entertainment)\n\nCompany\n\n*   [Talk with Sales](https://frame-io.drift.click/chat-with-an-expert)\n*   [Contact Us](https://frame.io/contact)\n\n[](https://www.adobe.com/ \"Adobe\")\u00a9 2024 Adobe Inc.
